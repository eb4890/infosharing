An experiment in information sharing in potentially disruptive technologies. 

This repo uses selective encryption of subdirectories to share with specific groups.

# Intro
We are likely in the future to create technologies like real artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and robotics. These have the possibility of radically reshaping society. In order to avoid the worst outcomes of war and mass economic displacement we need to try and shape the future somewhat.

There is a tension between openness and closed development of these technologies. Closed development done by responsible people will help people mitigate the bad points, they can shore up defences and potentially avoid arms races between powers. However closed development naturally leads to build up of power in one place and requires lots of trust in the closed group. It also means you do not get the benefit of science. You lose outside people seeing where your ideas are wrong, building on them and also you lose it's international collaborative nature. It promotes a winner take all attitude.

Fully open development of these technologies could lead to chaos as people try to develop and deploy them to get an economic/military advantage (afraid that someone else will get their first). So to avoid this you want some collaboration. Most people want to avoid war and chaos, so this can be something to collaborate on. Having a visible plan on how to avoid this and working towards it, should build trust for people to share information with you.

Regulation is one way of controlling the development of these technologies. However if you are a practitioner/company in these fields another possibility is selective data/idea sharing. This is only really possible if you have some free resources, if you are in a very competitive environment you probably won't be able to be ethical in your data sharing. See the section on Considerations for more thoughts on when you should share your information


# How

As this is just an experiment and unlikely to hold very important details. It will hold information on my projects in gpg encrypted format. There will be a classification of the info.

A - Advantage: Data shared may give an advantage to the sharee but by itself will not allow anything dangerous or disruptive 
D - Disruptive: Data shared will give a potentially disruptive capability

It will also hold details of my view of the world and what I think needs to be done (and the metrics I follow). Some data will be public, but it should be based off trying to improve those metrics,

It will start off encrpyted for myself, but as I find people to work with I will encrypt info for multiple recipients. I would prefer to detail publically who I share info with, as then there may be social pressure not to share information.

# Considerations

## Whether they act towards their stated goal

## What information thay have

## Who they share information with
